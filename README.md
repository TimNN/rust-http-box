# HTTP Box

HTTP Box is a zero-copy streaming HTTP parser, URL parser, and component decoder/encoder.

Making a fast, embeddable HTTP 1.1/2.x parser is the primary objective. HTTP Box is the perfect
library if you want to create a web server or HTTP proxy.

Development is currently in progress but moving forward steadily. Plan to have full HTTP 1.1
specification parsing finished by end of March 2016. Once complete, HTTP 2.x support will be
planned.

## Maintain Control

Each chunk of data is passed to a callback function. This callback function allows you to
prematurely exit the parser, but you remain in control, and can resume parsing at any point.
This will allow you to limit header and content size.

## Parsing Roadmap
